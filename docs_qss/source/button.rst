Button Style
============

The QPushButton has size, border, padding, margin and font that can be selected.

To understand the make up of a QPushButton look on the Box Model tab.

For more information on the Box Model see the
`Box Model <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/stylesheet-customizing.html#the-box-model>`_

.. note:: The margin, border-width, and padding properties all default to zero.
   In that case, all four rectangles (margin, border, padding, and content)
   coincide exactly.

Size
----

The size of the button can be set using the Min Width and Min Height. The Max
Width and Max Height can limit the size but clipping can occur. The size
increments are in pixels.
