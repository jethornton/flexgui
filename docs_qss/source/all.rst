Style All Widgets
=================

To apply the same color style to all widgets use the All tab.

Pick a Text Color or Background Color for the state you want that color to be.
The color Selector will popup and you can pick the color you want. Then click on
OK. If you click on Cancel it will remove any color previously selected.

Also note the Stylesheet tab in each widget tab has the QSS stylesheet code used
so you can copy and paste from there.

You can launch a sample GUI to see all the stylesheet changes at the same time.
