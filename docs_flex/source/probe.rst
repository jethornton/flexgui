Probing
=======

Probe Enable
------------

Add a QPushButton named `probing_enable_pb` and if it is found it will be set as
a toggle button. The button will only be enabled when the machine is homed and
not running a program. The button is set to checkable in code so it can be
styled with :checked and :enabled pseudo-states among others.

.. note:: The `probing_enable_pb` requires at least one object that starts with
   `probe_` to be enabled.

.. code-block:: css

	QPushButton#probing_enable_pb:enabled:checked {
		color: white;
		background-color: red;
	}

	QPushButton#probing_enable_pb:enabled {
		color: green;
		background-color: yellow;
	}

.. note:: A QPushButton with checkable set to true does not have an unchecked
   pseudo-state

For more style sheet options see the :doc:`style` section

The text on the Probe Enable button can be set by adding two Dynamic Properties
named `on_text` and `off_text`. Both must be present or no change will take
place as there is no default text for the Probe Enable button.
See :doc:`property`

This is what the button would look like with the above settings.

Function
--------

When the `probing_enable_pb` is toggled `OFF`, any widget with an object name
that starts with `probe_` will be disabled.

When the `probing_enable_pb` is toggled `ON` the widgets that start with
`probe_` will be enabled. In addition, spindle controls will disabled, spindle
speed set to 0, run controls will be disabled, and MDI controls will be disabled.

QPushButtons with an objectName that start with `probe_` and configured as a
:ref:`MdiButtonTag` (to launch the probing subroutines) will be enabled when
probing is enabled and disabled when probing is disabled.

You can create a HAL :ref:`SpinBoxTag` to use in your probing subroutine. Set
the objectName to start with `probe_` and it will be enabled and disabled with
the probe buttons.

If you're using a touch-screen, add a Dynamic Property named `input` and set
the value to `touch`.

Example
-------

A minimal example is in the Flex Examples in the Features directory

.. image:: /images/probe-02.png
   :align: center

To run the example, close the E Stop, turn Power on, Home all, then toggle the
Enable button. When probing is enabled many other controls are disabled
including the spindle.

To test the probe routine press the Probe X Plus button and the X axis will
start to move in the positive direction. If you do nothing when the Search
Distance is reached you will get an error that the G38.2 move finished without
making contact, which is expected.

Press the Probe X Plus button again and after it starts to move, press the Probe
Trip button, the X axis will back off the Backoff Distance and start to move in
the positive direction again. Pressing the Probe Trip button again will end the
probe simulation. The debug information will show up in the Information window.

Subroutine
----------

The probe subroutines use the values from the Probe Settings spin boxes. To use
these values, you need to make the spin box a HAL pin. See the :ref:`SpinBoxTag`
example in the HAL section.

The subroutine is located in a directory called `subroutines` that is in the
configuration directory. The ini's [RS274NGC] SUBROUTINE_PATH sets the path
that LinuxCNC looks for subroutines. Notice the leading ./ specifices that the
path to the current directory is where the subroutine directory is.
::

	SUBROUTINE_PATH = ./subroutines

The example files used are the following; notice that the xplus.ngc is in
the ./subroutines directory
::

	├── main.hal
	├── parameters.var
	├── parameters.var.bak
	├── postgui.hal
	├── probe.ini
	├── probe.ui
	├── README
	├── sim_axis_probe.ini
	├── subroutines
	│   └── xplus.ngc
	└── tool.tbl

In your subroutine you can use user parameters instead of using HAL pins.
See the :doc:`parameters` section.

The subroutine is a normal LinuxCNC subroutine. The magic is how you get the
values from HAL pins with `#<_hal[pin_name]>` where pin_name is the actual
pin name in HAL.
::

	(filename xplus.ngc)
	(HAL pins #<_hal[pin_name]>)
	(G90 absolute distance mode G91 incremental distance mode)
	o<xplus> sub
		(msg, xplus subroutine)
		G20
		; initial search
		G91 G38.2 F#<_hal[flexhal.search-speed]> X#<_hal[flexhal.search-distance]>
		;5061-5069 - Coordinates of a G38 probe result (X, Y, Z, A, B, C, U, V & W)
		(debug, Probe Contact at #5061)
		; back off using #5061 to compensate for over travel on the probe
		G90 G0 X[#5061-#<_hal[flexhal.backoff-distance]>]
		; final probe at latch speed
		G91 G38.2 F#<_hal[flexhal.latch-speed]> X[#<_hal[flexhal.backoff-distance]> + 0.02]
		(debug, Probe Contact at #5061)
	o<xplus> endsub
	M2

Looking at the Halshow window which pops up when you press the Show HAL button,
you can see the flexhal pin names for each spin box and for the Probe Trip
button. Also notice that the Probe Trip button is connected to a signal which is
connected to motion.probe-input in the postgui.hal file
