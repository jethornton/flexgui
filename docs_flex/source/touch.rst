Touch Screens
=============

Some entry widgets like MDI and Touch-Off have a touch-screen popup available
to make it easier for those users to enter the data.


Tool Bar
--------

To add a button to the tool bar without having a menu item that creates an
action, you just have to create the action yourself

   :align: center

The action creating window, when you type in the Text name, the Object name is
created for you

   :align: center

.. warning:: Make sure the Object name matches the Action Name created when
   you create a menu item - see the :doc:`menu` section for the full list of
   Action Names.

Now you just drag the action into the tool bar to create a new tool bar button

Another option is to just use QPushButtons in a QFrame, as every menu action
has a QPushButton as well that executes the same function.

MDI
---

To enable the popup entry dialogs for the MDI entry, the QLineEdit object name
must be `mdi_command_le` and the Dynamic Property `input` must be `nccode` for
the NC codes popup or `keyboard` for a full keyboard popup.

The G codes dialog will appear when you touch the MDI entry box

The arrow buttons change the letters section to different letters

The full keyboard

   :align: center


Touch Off
---------

The Coordinate System Touch-Off offset is a QLineEdit named `touchoff_le`.
To enable the number pad popup for the offset entry, add a Dynamic Property
named `input` and set the value to `number`

   :align: center

Touch-Off:

Tool Touch-Off
--------------

The Tool Touch-Off offset is a QLineEdit named `tool_touchoff_le`. To enable
the number pad popup for the offset entry, add a Dynamic Property named
`input` and set the value to `number`.

Spin Boxes
----------

QDoubleSpinBox and QSpinBox can use the popup numbers keypad by adding a
Dynamic Property named `input` and seting the value to `number`. If you enter
a float value for a QSpinBox the value will get converted to an integer

Line Edits
----------

A QLineEdit can have a popup entry for numbers, G codes, or a full keyboard.
Add a Dynamic Property named `input` and set the value to one of these
`number`, `nccode`, or `keyboard`.

File Navigator
--------------

If a QListWidget with an objectName of `file_lw` is found, a touch-friendly
file selector is added. A Parent Directory and possibly a directory name with
an ellipsis can be used to change directories. Touch a file name and it is
loaded into the GUI.

If PROGRAM_PREFIX is specified, that will be the starting directory:
