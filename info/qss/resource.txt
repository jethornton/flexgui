Relative Path (to the executable's directory):

background-image: url("images/my_image.png");

This assumes an images folder exists in the same directory as your application's
executable.

Absolute Path:

background-image: url("C:/Users/username/Desktop/images/my_image.png");

Note that forward slashes (/) must be used even on Windows, as backslashes (\)
are invalid in QSS URLs.

Qt Resource System Path (Recommended for built-in images):
If you add your images to a Qt resource file (.qrc), you can use a consistent,
platform-independent path that is compiled into your application.

background-image: url(":/images/my_image.png");

The :/ prefix indicates a path within the resource system. 

Key Considerations

Quotation Marks: The quotes around the URL are optional, but using them can
improve clarity.

Path Resolution: Relative paths are resolved relative to the current working
directory of the running application, which can vary. Using the Qt Resource
System is the most robust way to ensure images are always found, as they are
embedded within the application.

No Spaces in URL: In some specific older Qt versions or parser implementations,
spaces within the url() function (e.g., url( :/images/scrollIcon.svg )) might
cause issues, so url(:/images/scrollIcon.svg) is safer.
