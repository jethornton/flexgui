To bore a single hole use Bore Mill for all setting.
Load a an endmill at least the hole radius size in the spindle and 
set the Z length offset ahead of this and enter the TOOL DIAM (or make multiple passes).

FEED & SPEED for Mill are set in Bore Mill not in Hole Pattern.

Z-CLEAR for the bore is set here. During loops Z-CLEAR in the Pattern Tab
is also read. 

Only Pattern parameters are set up the pattern,
XCENTER, YCENTER, DIAMETER, HOLES, START ANGLE.

Position X0 Y0 where you want to start the pattern. An X Y offset
in Pattern will be honored by Bore MILL and RIGID TAP.
Press the " RUN COUNTERSINK" button.

To run a pattern, set the bore parameters in Bore Mill.
Settings for the Counterbore and Rigid tap are independent
of the settings in Hole Pattern excepting for the pattern.

When running with pattern, X Y Center in Bore Mill Must be at 0.

Z-CLEAR is the start point for the helix. It will cut to the 
desired depth from Z0 regardless where Z-CLEAR is set above Z0.
HOLE DEPTH is from Z0.
