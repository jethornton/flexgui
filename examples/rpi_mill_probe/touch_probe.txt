For edge probe routines, place the touch probe in front of the edge or
corner to be probed at a Z level that will touch the face. Make sure 
XY SEARCH DIST is long enough to reach the edge.

For angle routnes place the touch probe in front of the edge
on the end with the shortest distance to the probe. It will use the 
ANGLE BASE DIST to determine wherre to start probing the 2nd point
of the hypotenuse.

The bar probe will touch off Z to establish the top then move to the
side to probe each edge. Make sure MAX BAR RAD is long 
enough to clear the edge.

The hole probe is similar except to place the probe depth just inside
the hole. Make sure MAX HOLE RAD is set long enough to reach the edge.

For inside/outside measurements make sure XY TRAVEL DIST is long enough to clear the edges.
