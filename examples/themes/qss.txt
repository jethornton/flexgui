/***** QAbstractSpinBox *****/
In PyQt6, the subcontrol-origin property is used in stylesheets to define the
reference rectangle (e.g., margin, border, padding, or content) against which
the QSpinBox sub-controls (the ::up-button and ::down-button) are positioned.
Values for subcontrol-origin: margin, border, padding (default), content, frame

/***** QScrollBar *****/
QScrollBar:vertical: This selector targets the vertical scrollbar itself. Properties here define its overall size and background.
QScrollBar::handle:vertical: This styles the "thumb" or "slider"—the part you drag to scroll. Key properties include background and min-height.
QScrollBar::add-line:vertical and QScrollBar::sub-line:vertical: These style the arrow buttons at the ends of the scrollbar.

    subcontrol-position and subcontrol-origin are crucial for placing these buttons correctly at the top/bottom or left/right.

QScrollBar::add-page:vertical and QScrollBar::sub-page:vertical: These refer to the areas above and below the handle. Setting their background to none allows the main scrollbar background to show through.
:hover pseudo-state: Used to define styles when the mouse cursor is over a specific sub-control, providing visual feedback.
