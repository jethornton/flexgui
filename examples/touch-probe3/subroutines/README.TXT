USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
Note: due to the nature of tool setter locaions and cnc setups
the p_tool.ngc has been left in for a GUIDE ONLY. Deternine what works
best for your setup. Feel free to modify these routines to your liking. 

To make user variables persistent create an entry in the .var file for each one as indicated.
2000	0.000000
2001	0.000000
. . . .
2070	0.000000

The values entered from the UI will be saved to the .var file loaded upon startup and 
updated as changes are made. The following user number variables are used or reserved
for use with these probe routines.
Some are used in the UI file and some are workspace variables.
