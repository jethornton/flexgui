To mill a slot use Slot Mill for all setting.

Load an endmill at least half slot width size in the spindle 
(or make multiple passes) and set the Z length offset ahead of time.

Set X1 Y1 where you want to start the slot. 

Set X2 Y2 where you want to end the slot.

The distance is between arc centers end to end.

Set the SLOT WIDTH. Must be greater than the TOOL DIAM.

Set the SLOT DEPTH (Negative value).

Enter the TOOL DIAM. Must be less than the SLOT WIDTH.

Enter RAMP %. A percent of TOOL DIAM for ramp passes. Range is 20-50.

Set the Z-CLEAR for the slot (0 or greater). It is also the Z-Start plane. 
It will cut to the desired depth from Z0 regardless where Z-CLEAR is set above Z0.

Set the FEED & SPEED for Mill accordingly.
