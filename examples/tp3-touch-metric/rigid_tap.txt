To tap a single hole use the Rigid Tap tab for all setting.
Load a tap in the spindle and set the Z length offet to the
material or your fixture offset Z0 level. Z-CLEAR must be above this.

Z-CLEAR for the tap is set here. During loops Z-CLEAR in the Pattern Tab
is also read.
Z-CLEAR must be greater than Z-START

SPINDLE RPM for tap is set here even if using the Hole Pattern.

LINEAR FEED is used for linear Z moves to the tap cycle only.

PITCH MM enter the thread pitch (threads per mm).

When running with pattern, X Y Center in Rigid Tap Must be at 0.

Only Pattern parameters are set up the pattern,
XCENTER, YCENTER< DIAMETER, HOLES, START ANGLE.

Position X0 Y0 in Hole Pattern where you want to start the pattern.
An X Y offset in Pattern will be honored by Rigid Tap and Bore Mill.

With "HOLE/TAP set to 1, press the "RUN COUNTERSINK" button for the tap op.

To run a pattern, set the tap parameters in Rigid Tap.
Settings for the Counterbore and Rigid tap are independent
of the settings in Hole Pattern excepting for the pattern.

Z-START is the start point for Rigid Tapping. It will tap to 
HOLE DEPTH then retract to Z-CLEAR.
